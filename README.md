## Introduction

In this repository, I have documented my journey of learning data structures and algorithms in C++. Each program is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments within the code, providing insights into the logic and implementation.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for myself and others who are interested in learning or revising data structures and algorithms using C++. Feel free to explore the folders and code files to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific data structure or algorithm. Here is a brief overview of the folder structure:

- `Arrays`: Contains programs related to array manipulation and algorithms.
- `Linked Lists`: Includes programs that implement various types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- `Stacks and Queues`: Contains implementations of stack and queue data structures.
- `Trees`: Includes programs related to various types of trees, such as binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
- `Graphs`: Contains implementations of graph-related algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
- `Sorting Algorithms`: Includes different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- `Searching Algorithms`: Contains programs related to searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, etc.

Feel free to explore each folder to find the specific data structures or algorithms you are interested in.

## Usage
